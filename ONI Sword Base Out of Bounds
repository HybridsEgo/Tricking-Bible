# Winter Contingency Out of Bounds glitches

When playing the mission ONI: Sword Base, note that your checkpoints are timed so take your time and delay your checkpoints if needed.

# Out of the very beginning (or coming back to the courtyard later)

Start at mission start with 2 players with tilt and cowbell skulls enabled.  Take the concussion rifle from the elite that gets dropped off by the phantom and kill all the enemies so they don't get in your way.  If you want a vehicle out of the map to launch it at this point, you can use your armor locks or concussion rifle to launch it out of the map.  Have the player not getting out of the map carry the concussion rifle.  Launch a forklift onto the upper slant near the ramp by the sniper spawn.  Have the player getting out enter the vehicle while not in the barrier, and drive as high and as far right of the slant as you can, when the forklift can no longer go any higher, have the concussion player carefully shoot the back of your forklift so you will be pushed further into the barrier.  Exit the forklift when you are as out as possible and you should be out of the map.  Face towards where you first spawn in, and walk along the right side or the tower and walk on top the curved wall until you are on top of the gate you are supposed to progress.  Jump onto the top of the gate, then jump on top of the mountain, remember, you have timed checkpoints so take your time and revert if necessary.  Retrieve your vehicle if you launch any out and explore.

If you are breaking out at a later point of the mission make sure you do not mess with the forklifts from the begining as much as possible.  Moving them then progressing the mission may cause them to deload in some cases.

# Armor lock out using first warthog pelican

Play through the mission and progress to the part where you fight off the 2 wraiths with a target locator, or start at rally point alpha (Original Halo: Reach) or rally point bravo (Halo The Master Chief Collection).  Hijack a wraith and park it where the nos of the pelican would be.  Delay a checkpoint then kill the 2nd wraith and all other enemies.  Retrieve your checkpoint when the pelican flies in, jump onto the pelican from the wraith you parked and armor lock on the pelican.  Once completed, jump off the pelican and land on a slant by the rocks on the floor and survive your fall.  Once you're out, explore.

If you are on The Masterchief Collection, currently there is a bug that forces you out of armor lock and into a “floaty” state.  Try to lodge yourself in the back left engine and armor lock once it's done rising.  Then jump/acro to survive the fall and explore out of the map.

# Armor lock out of map using AA gun warthog pelican (hitting right objective first)

Start ONI sword base on MCC with acrophobia skull enabled.  Advance to the AA gun objective first, clear all the enemies and delay a checkpoint.  Hit the objective button that activates the AA gun and retrieve your checkpoint once the pelican flies in.  Because of the floaty bug try to lodge yourself into the back left engine once it’s done rising.  Use acro to fly off and explore.

Because of the floaty bug try to armor lock on the left wing of the pelican to break out.  Use acro to fly off and explore.

# Armor lock out of map middle spirit

Start ONI Swordbase on MCC with Acrophobia.  Proceed to the spirit in the middle of the objective.  As the spirit rises armor lock on the back left of the spirit.  Fly on top of the spirit once it's done dropping off the grunts so the spirit doesn't wobble and shake you off or into the floaty bug.  Armor lock until out of the map fly off and explore.
